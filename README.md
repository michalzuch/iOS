# iOS
Projects built during Mobile devices programming - Apple iOS classes at Jagiellonian University

> Although these projects were created as part of my classes, I have dedicated extra effort to make them well-designed and carefully crafted. While they are relatively simple, they have been developed with care and attention to detail.
